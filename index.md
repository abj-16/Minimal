## Machine Learning

I use Scikit Learn and statsmodels library available for modelling different algorithms depending on bussiness problem. I created ML models for regression and classification problems by using algorithms like Linear and Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest etc. and using different techniques for hyperparameters tuning for better metrics.

### Bike sharing business problem

* Created a Multiple Linear Regression model for understanding the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It can be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features like season, month of year etc.
* They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model helped management to understand the demand dynamics.
* Dataset used was provided online by Upgrad team.

### House Price Prediction

* Created a Advanced Regression model for a company based in US which needs to expand its business in Austrailian market. Model helps in understanding how different parameters are considered for pricing a particular house like no. of bedrooms, locality, parking, basement etc. to make decisions.
* Data was provided by the Upgrad team for the modelling process.

### Car Price Prediction

* Used Linear regression algorithm to identify what are the important factors responsible for predicting the price of a car.
* I used Kaggle datasets for my algorithm.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Using mathematical and visualization libraries in Python like Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn. We Import, Clean, Summarize and Visualize the Data for our specific Business or Personal requirements or decision making.

### Lending Problem Dataset

* I did a small project on EDA of the financial company which requires to analyse based on the data which type of customers are more likely to default the loan or which customers would not based on assessment of certain parameters like interest rates, tenure of loan, income range etc.
* Collected the data online from Upgrad and did cleaning and processing work on it to find important parameters which need to be considered for a financial company to make business decisions.

### Spotify top Songs country-wise Dataset

* Performing EDA on the dataset which had top 100 songs of a specific year based on different countries. I analysed which country customers would like which kind of genres and analysed them based on different parameters like release date, song duration, platform etc.
* This can be used by the company in order to give specific recommendations to the users.
