### Lending Problem Dataset

I did a small project on EDA of the financial company which requires to analyse based on the data which type of customers are more likely to default the loan or which customers would not based on assessment of certain parameters like interest rates, tenure of loan, income range etc.

### Spotify top Songs country-wise Dataset

I used Kaggle to search for some different datasets where I can apply the EDA techniques on.
I used a dataset which had top 100 songs of a specific year based on different countries. I analysed which country customers would like which kind of genres and analysed them based on different parameters like release date, song duration, platform etc.
